## Technologies

- **Java 17**

- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 Database**
- **Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)**
- **JUnit and Mockito for testing**

## Project Architecture Description

The architecture of the User Management API is based on a modular and scalable approach, using best software development practices. Below are the main components and their interaction:

## Flowchart: User Registration Process

1. **Start**
2. **Receive Registration Request**
   - The controller receives user data.
3. **Validate Data**
   - Checks that all required fields are complete and in the correct format.
   - If the data is invalid, an error message is returned.
4. **Check Email Existence**
   - Checks if the email is already registered.
   - If the email already exists, an error message is returned.
5. **Register User**
   - Saves the new user in the database.
6. **Return Success Response**
   - Sends a response with the registration status.
7. **End**

## Data Diagram: Structure of Users and Phones

### Entities

- **users**
   - `id`: UUID (Unique identifier for the user)
   - `name`: String (User's name)
   - `email`: String (Email address)
   - `password`: String (Encrypted password)
   - `isActive`: Boolean (User's status)
   - `created`: Date (Creation date)
   - `modified`: Date (Modification date)

- **phone**
   - `id`: UUID (Unique identifier for the phone)
   - `number`: String (Phone number)
   - `type`: String (Type of phone, e.g., personal, work)
   - `userId`: UUID (Reference to the user to whom the phone belongs)

### Relationships

- **A User can have multiple Phones.**
   - One-to-many relationship between User and Phone.

### 1. **General Architecture**

The API follows an **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, where:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and business logic. Uses JPA entities to interact with the database.
- **View:** Not used in this project as it is a REST API, but Swagger documentation can be considered as a user interface to interact with the API.
- **Controller:** Manages HTTP requests and defines the API endpoints.

### 2. **Key Components**

- **REST Controllers:** Responsible for receiving requests and returning responses. Each controller corresponds to a resource (users, phones, etc.) and uses services to handle business logic.

- **Services:** Contain the business logic of the application. Services interact with repositories to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

- **Repositories:** Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. Provide methods to perform operations on entities.

- **Security:** Implements authentication and authorization using Spring Security. The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions.

### 3. **Data Flow**

1. **Client Request:** The client sends an HTTP request to one of the API endpoints.
2. **Controller:** The controller receives the request and validates it. If the data is valid, it calls the corresponding service.
3. **Service:** The service executes the business logic and may interact with one or more repositories to access the data.
4. **Repository:** Performs the necessary operations in the database.
5. **Response:** The service returns the results to the controller, which formats the response and sends it back to the client.

### 4. **Database**

**H2 Database** is used as an in-memory database for development and testing. In production, it can be configured to use other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### 5. **Documentation and Swagger**

The API is documented using **Swagger**, allowing developers and users to explore the endpoints, required parameters, and expected responses interactively.

### 6. **Tests**

Unit and integration tests are implemented using **JUnit** and **Mockito** to ensure that each component works as expected.

### 7. **Deployment**

The application can be packaged as a JAR file and deployed on any Java-compatible server. It can also be containerized using Docker to facilitate deployment in production environments.

## Installation
